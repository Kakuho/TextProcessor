OF Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit


Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast



Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,

With loss of Eden, till one greater Man



Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,


Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top





Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire

That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,


In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth

Rose out of Chaos: or if Sion Hill





Delight thee more, and Siloa's brook that flow'd
