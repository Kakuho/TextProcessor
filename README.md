This project is a textprocessor for formatting my cover letters. The idea is that it involves different functionalities which would make writting cover letters
easier on my laptop. I use vim to write my cover letters and I have a tendency to break sentences up by going on a new line in the middle of them, as 
they look better that way on vim.

Hence I implemented a paragrapher tool in order to fix this. I also want to add article fixers, tool for correct capitalisation, a character counter 
as my vim does not have this and a vowel corrector. Further I want to learn how to format text on the command line better and as such I want to create a 
diaplayer utility to show the formatted text correctly.
